<div align="center">
  <p>I have implemented the Pac-Map game using the Assembly language and the Canvas library!</p>

  <p>The map is based on a matrix, allowing for easy creation of new levels or difficulties.</p>
  <p>Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts ðŸ‘¾ on the map; they can sense his presence and become agitated if he gets too close.</p>

  <p>Pac-Man can eat the cherries on the map, which grant bonus points and give him the ability to eat the ghosts for a short period of time!</p>
